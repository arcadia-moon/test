Smart contract systems that process signed messages have to implement their own logic to recover the authenticity from the signed messages before they process them further. A limitation for such systems is that smart contracts can not directly interact with them because they can not sign messages. Some signature verification implementations attempt to solve this problem by assuming the validity of a signed message based on other methods that do not have this limitation. An example of such a method is to rely on msg.sender and assume that if a signed message originated from the sender address then it has also been created by the sender address. This can lead to vulnerabilities especially in scenarios where proxies can be used to relay transactions.","to":"/T0026","examples":[{"id":"EX0026","title":"EXAMPLE 0026","description":"Tactics represent the \\"why\\" of an ATT&CK technique or sub-technique.

Since abi.encodePacked() packs all elements in order regardless of whether they\'re part of an array, you can move elements between arrays and, so long as all elements are in the same order, it will return the same encoding. In a signature verification situation, an attacker could exploit this by modifying the position of elements in a previous function call to effectively bypass authorization.","to":"/T0027","examples":[{"id":"EX0027","title":"EXAMPLE 0027","description":"Tactics represent the \\"why\\" of an ATT&CK technique or sub-technique.
