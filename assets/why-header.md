## Why SCTM?

1. Growing Prevalence of Smart Contracts:
With the increasing adoption of blockchain technologies, smart contracts are becoming ubiquitous in various domains including finance, healthcare, supply chain, and more. A specialized TTP matrix would be pivotal in understanding and mitigating the unique set of threats posed to these decentralized applications.

2. Complexity and Diversification:
Smart contracts are becoming more complex and diverse in functionality, expanding their risk surface. A dedicated TTP matrix would enable the identification of subtle, complex vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques specific to smart contracts, fostering a more secure development environment.

3. Enhanced Security Posture:
A specialized TTP matrix for smart contracts would contribute to enhanced security posture by providing a structured framework to identify, analyze, and mitigate potential threats and vulnerabilities in a systematic manner, thereby reducing the risks of security breaches and exploitation.

4. Development of Mitigation Strategies:
Having a dedicated TTP matrix allows for the development of tailored mitigation strategies and defensive measures, enabling organizations to better protect their assets and users against smart contract-related threats, reducing potential damages and losses.

5. Accelerated Innovation:
The development of a smart contract-specific TTP matrix can promote accelerated innovation in the blockchain space by providing clearer insights into security aspects, helping developers, auditors, and users to understand and navigate the threat landscape more effectively.

6. Informed Decision-Making:
Organizations and individuals could make more informed decisions regarding the deployment and use of smart contracts when equipped with a comprehensive understanding of the associated threats and vulnerabilities, facilitated by a specialized TTP matrix.

7. Standardization and Best Practices:
Developing a smart contract-specific TTP matrix would aid in establishing standardized security practices and benchmarks, promoting a uniform approach to smart contract security and facilitating interoperability and compliance across different blockchain platforms.

8. User Trust and Adoption:
Enhanced security through a smart contract-centric TTP matrix would inevitably foster greater trust among end-users and could accelerate the adoption of smart contracts and associated technologies by alleviating security concerns.

While the creation of a smart contract-specific TTP matrix involves overcoming numerous challenges, the benefits such a framework would bring in terms of enhanced security, innovation acceleration, and user trust are substantial. It would act as a catalyst for the secure and robust development of smart contract technologies, aiding in the realization of their full potential in reshaping various industries and societal systems.
